async await >> promise chains >> callback hell

SYNCHRONOUS means that every instruction in a program is executed in the order its written and every instruction waits 
for its previous instruction to be executed.

In SYNCHRONOUS programming sometimes imp instructions get blocked because of prev instructions, which causes 
delays in UI. ASYNCHRONOUS code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesnt block the 
flow.
